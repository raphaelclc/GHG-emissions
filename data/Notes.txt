Units and substances																
																
GHG emissions include CO2 (fossil only), CH4, N2O and F-gases. They are aggregated using Global Warming Potential values from IPCC AR5 (GWP-100 AR5).																
																
values in GHG_totals_by_country sheet are expressed in Mt CO2eq/yr 																
values in GHG_by_sector_and_country sheet are expressed in Mt CO2eq/yr																
values in LULUCF by macro regions sheet are expressed in Mt CO2eq/yr 																
values in GHG_per_GDP_by_country sheet are expressed in t CO2eq/kUSD/yr																
values in GHG_per_capita_by_countr sheet are expressed in t CO2eq/cap/yr																
																
Metric units are used.																
																
Sector definition																
																
Power Industry - Power and heat generation plants (public & autoproducers)																
Industrial combustion - Combustion for industrial manufacturing																
Buildings – Small scale non-industrial stationary combustion																
Transport – Mobile combustion (road & rail & ship & aviation)																
Agriculture  Agricultural soils, crop residues burning, enteric fermentation, manure management, indirect N2O emissions from agriculture																
Fuel exploitation - Production, transformation and refining of fuels																
Processes - Industrial processes (e.g. emissions from the production of cement, iron and steel, aluminum, chemicals, solvents, etc.)																
Waste - Solid waste disposal and waste water treatment																
																
LULUCF																
CO2 emissions from Forest Land (Rossi et al., in prep.), Deforestation, Drainage of Organic Soils, Other Land use and their conversion (Grassi et al., 2022).																
Wildfire GHG emissions are also included using the GWIS estimates (Global Wildfire Information System).
